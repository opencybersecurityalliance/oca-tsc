### Contributing to TSC-Managed Documentation

This repository publishes TSC-managed documentation such as OCA project guideline, including code requirement, governance specification, contribution workflow, etc. TSC members are responsible for initializing and drafting the first version of a documentation collaboratively, with help from other OCA membmers. After the release of a documentation in this repo, the documentation will become public accessible and welcome to comments, suggestions, and edits by GitHub Issues and Pull Requests (PR) from members of any OCA project. TSC will discuss tickets in GitHub Issues monthly and merge PR to improve a documentation.

All contributions must be covered by a [Contributor's License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/opencybersecurityalliance/oasis-open-project) and [ECLA](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/entity-cla-20210630/) (if you are contributing on behalf of your employer). You will get a prompt to sign this document when you submit your first PR.
