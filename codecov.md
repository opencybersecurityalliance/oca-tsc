# Code Coverage

TSC enables [codecov](https://codecov.io/) for the entire OCA GitHub
organization, and any repo in the organization will be automatically covered.

For a OCA repo to start use codecov, the only thing needs to be done is to

1. generate coverage report, and
2. upload it to codecov.

The codecov team bot will automatically comment on a PR if the two steps are
automated for a PR, e.g., in the continuous integration procedure like unit
testing for PR.
